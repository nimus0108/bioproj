                <h2>Farming and Urban Development</h2>
                <p>The biggest impact that humans have on grasslands is by developing open areas for farming or urban development. Such development is prevalent because grasslands are generally level areas with little need for major work to develop the land. The development of land drives animals away from populated areas and changes the conditions of the environment.</p>
                
                <h2>Animal Life</h2>
                <p>Prairie animals are being endangered, because farmers think they are pests - they burrow and can cause injury to cattle and horses - and kill them, even though it is illegal. In addition, hunting has had and continues to have a serious impact on the biome, with people illegally poaching endangered animals.</p>
                
                <h2>Positive Effects</h2>
                <p>However, humans do not have only a negative impact on grasslands. There are some that do their part to preserve the land and restore it. National parks have been developed around grasslands, and some organizations replant areas of depleted grassland. Governments have enacted laws against the hunting of endangered animals.</p>                      <p>While poaching still exists in many areas, there are efforts to stop it.</p>
