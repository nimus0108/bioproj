            <p>-Grasslands do not have lots of trees or bushes
<br>-So most of the animals there are grazing animals that travel in herds

                    <h3>African Elephant</h3>
                    <p>Herbivore</p>
                    <p>It has larger ears and tusks than the Asian species. Females are smaller than males and have shorter tusks. Elephants rest in the mid-day heat and have one or two periods of rest at night but are otherwise active at any time. An elephant may consume up to 200 kg (440 lb) of plant material a day. It eats by grasping the food with the trunk and placing in the mouth. It eats leaves, twigs, roots and fruit. They are social animals.</p>

                    <p>The lion is powerfully built with a head, strong legs and a long tail. Males are larger than females, and they live in herds of about 3 males and more females. It spends most of the day resting (at least 20 hours). They prey on mammals.</p>

                    <p>Herbivore</p>
                    <p>The giraffe has amazingly long necks. They have irregular coloration of dark spots on their bodies, but all of this varies. They live in herds of about 6 to 12 giraffes. Graffes eat plants, grass, and crops. When females give birth, they give birth to one offspring. </p>
