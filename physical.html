                <h3>Background Information</h3>
                <p>There are two main divisions of the grassland biome. One is the temperate grassland and the other is the savanna, or the tropical grassland.
Grasslands are called many names in different place such as how North America calls it Prairies, it’s Steppes in Asia, African Savannas and Veldts, Australia calls it Rangelands, and South American Pampas, Llanos and Cerrados.</p>
                
                <h3>Temperate Grassland</h3>
                <p>These grasslands normally exist in the interior of continents. Temperate grasslands have nutrient rich and fertile soil so (in areas not disturbed by humans) it’s capable of supporting large herds of grazing mammals and herbivores. So grass was the main vegetation of the land. The rich soil is from the branched, decaying grass roots. Even with a great deal of razing from the large groups of herds and the infrequent fires, grasses continue to endure this and survive.</p>
                <p>The temperate grassland is relatively drier than the tropical grassland. This is due to the weather’s effects. It has hot summers and cold winters. Whereas summer temperatures can go over 100°F and winter temperatures can go low as -40°F. The rainfall is average compared to other biomes like a forest, however, it’s still not enough to support trees. The average amount of precipitation per year is in the range of 20-35 inches. </p>
                
                <h3>Savannas</h3>
                <p>Savannas, or tropical grasslands, are usually located in tropical and subtropical areas near the equator. Savannas are filled with scattered deciduous trees, shrubs, and tall grass. It contains a large variety of grazing animals and carnivores, so it is known as “big game country.” Soil isn’t as nutritious as temperate grasslands because of it’s thin layer of humus (which is the organic portion of the soil). Also, the soil is porous so water drainage is rapid and fast. </p>
                <p>Savannas/tropical grasslands receive more rainfall than temperate grasslands. It gets more rainfall than deserts, but less than tropical or temperate rainforests. Unlike temperate grasslands, savannas have wet and dry seasons, which makes it difficult for animals plants during the drought season. Savannas are hot all year long and can be extremely dry. Unlike the temperate grasslands, the annual rainfall is about 20-50 inches per year.</p>
